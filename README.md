# 🌿 Mini Smart Greenhouse + Digital Twin

A hands-on **personal engineering project** combining hardware, software, and plants.  
Built to learn, grow, and eventually scale into a fully self-sustaining greenhouse system.

---

## 🧭 Overview
The **Mini Smart Greenhouse** is a Raspberry Pi + ESP32-based system that automates watering, lighting, and climate control — all while mirroring real-world conditions in a digital twin simulation.

It starts as a small indoor greenhouse for herbs like basil and mint — but is designed to scale toward a future backyard greenhouse powered by renewable inputs and predictive automation.

---

## 🚀 Core Goals
- 🌱 Grow herbs and vegetables automatically.  
- 🧠 Learn IoT, data logging, and environmental control.  
- 💻 Build a **digital twin** to simulate temperature, humidity, and soil dynamics.  
- ⚡ Design for **scalability** — from desktop tent → full greenhouse.  
- 🌞 Move toward sustainability (solar, water recycling, nutrient dosing).
